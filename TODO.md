TODO

- It should listen to the Twitter streaming API and save new tweets as they come in.
- On save, an event should be emitted to the client side that will update the views.
- The page should render server side initially, and the client side should take it from there.
- We should use infinity scroll pagination to load blocks of 10 tweets at a time.
- New unread tweets should have a notification bar that will prompt the user to view them.
